### Mode of Delivery

This workshop will be run on a [Nectar](https://nectar.org.au/) Instance. An “Instance” is Nectar terminology for a virtual machine running on the Nectar Cloud OpenStack infrastructure. An “Instance” runs on a “compute node”; i.e. a physical computer populated with processor chips, memory chips and so on.

You will be given an individual IP address and password to log on to using the SSH client tool on your computer (Terminal on Mac or PuTTY on Windows).

Should you wish to complete this workshop independently, you can do so locally (for Mac and LINUX users) or via binder (for Windows users).
