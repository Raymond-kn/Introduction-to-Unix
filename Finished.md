#### Finished

Well done, you learnt a lot over the last 8 sections; itâ€™s a lot to take in!

From here you should be comfortable around the Unix command line and be ready to complete other workshops based on the command line here at Melbourne Bioinformatics.

You will no-doubt forget a lot of what you learnt here so we encourage you to save a link to this workshop for later reference.

## Additional Resources

This workshop is just the tip of the Unix iceberg! There is lots more to learn out there. Below are some resources that will help with further learning.

- [The HPC workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/research-computing-services-10600096884) run by Research Computing Services (University of Melbourne researchers only) are a great intro to using a command-line interface to access a HPC system.

- [This tutorial](https://www.berniepope.id.au/assets/files/intro_to_unix.pdf) is a detailed intro to Unix programming by A/Prof Bernie Pope.
